# Mikasa Saves the Village

important disclaimer: I spent 40 minutes writing my documentation but everything got deleted so I'm rewriting it

## How Did I Come Up With the Idea:
At first, I wanted to make a game that I used to play in my childhood called "Super Cow", which is a game about a Cow who wanted to save her village and the citizens of that village from bad animals that occupied the whole land. I also wanted to make a game with different characters (protagonists and antagonists), so that there's going to be a little plot in a game. However, this game was based on a character jumping on platforms on a continuous game screen, so I didn't want to copy the entire thing. That's why I decided to integrate the grid that I've learned during the previous classes. Thus, I got an idea of making a maze and still incorporating the idea of a character saving the village. During the actual coding process, however, when I had some issues, I was thinking of giving up on that idea and creating something that would be a bit easier - with an easier idea. However, I reminded myself the true thought behind the idea: it was because of the recent events in the world, when countries are getting occupied and invaded by othe governments and civil people are suffering because of it. So I decided to keep the idea till the end, no matter how hard it would eventually get.

Super Cow game that I was inspired by:

## About the simpler idea that I had - I actually even started working on it
I decided that before making my actual idea come true, I first need to divide my code into several parts: making the objects for my characters, coding my grid, and coding the functions of my character like collecting the coins and so on. Before doing the last part, I realized that I still was a bit unsure about how to use functions in different games, which is why I decided to practice on making a simple snake game:
