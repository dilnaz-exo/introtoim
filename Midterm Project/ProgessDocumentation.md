# DOCUMENTATION OF MY MIDTERM GAME PROGRESS ðŸ“Œ

## My Idea / Expectations:
I got inspired by the game that I played when I was a child called "Super Cow". In that game, a cow is saving its village and the village habitants from an unknown
someone that took away their land. For my game, I'd like to develop this idea into a game with a main character of a girl, a regular citizen from a country Peaceland, which has been attacked by a violent dictator of a neighbouring country. To save their country, she needs to collect cultural attributes and coins, while destroying aggressive trolls on her way.
