## My expectations: 
Before starting this homework, I thought of doing something that could visualize a phrase "seeing the world through rose colored glasses".
I expected that I will create a shape of glasses and put randomized shapes with random colors inside of the lens, but then I realized that with using constantly
increasing values of i and j it will be hard for me. However, since i liked the idea of rose colored glasses, I decided to keep it.

## Process + Problems I faced:
- I knew that I'm a person who is not very into abstract ideas or requirements, which is why I want everything to be explained in details, so that I know what all
the steps should be. However, since this small art work should wholly come from my imagination, I struggled with what to start from and how to continue.
- This is why I decided to use a familiar syntax of nested for loops and start from that. At first, I had a completely different work, but since it didn't showcase my
idea of rose colored vision, I kept pushing it to look like that at the end. 
- I kept experimenting with the random colors and kept ending up with the colors that I didn't want. It's a pure coincidence that those colors ended up looking like
that, and I'm really glad for it.
- The line that is under the while loop is meant to be something like a shield that restricts a dreamy way of thinking a person has.
