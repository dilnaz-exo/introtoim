### My expectations before doing the self-portrait:
- The idea of doing the self-portrait was really interesting for me, because it allows me to be creative while coding, which is always an exciting experience.
Before starting, I was a little anxious about the x, y values of each shape, because I thought that it would take a lot of time for me to actually align equally
each ellipse, line, etc. However, I was very eager to learn.
- I had multiple ideas about which exactly self-portrait I would like to do, and looked through different photos of mine, but since they all were from different angles,
I decided to rely on my own perception of myself.
### Progress:
- As I wrote, I felt a little anxious about coordinates (x,y values of each shape), but then I decided to pick those values according to the mouseX and mouseY.
I just navigated my mouse to the point I would like to put my ellipse and etc, and used print function to see which coordinates those points had. After a while, though,
it became almost intuitive for me to put different x,y values, as I got used to the dimensions of my canvas.
- I found it particularly interesting to play around with arc() shape! Especially to do my brows on the self-portrait. I was very happy when I saw how my right brow
came out just by using one arc(), but things got a bit more difficult when it came to my left brow. As you might already have noticed, the left brow looks kind of
inverted and gives a funny look, and the problem was that I didn't know how to rotate it. I looked at internet resources, and saw some advice, but decided to keep it
that way, because I thought that it makes my portrait look a bit more creative.
- I also loved making the heart shapes for my eyes! It's so interesting that so many things can be done without actually drawing, just by coding at putting coordinates
together.
