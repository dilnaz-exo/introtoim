## Video Game: International Road Trip

### A little background:
Since the idea of our game initially involved a "car moving" aspect for that, we explored different options of making this game as engaging and fun as
possible for the user. We were thinking of only making a "traveling" or "sightseeing" kind of game where the background scenery changes according to the
time change/speed or anything like that. There, we stopped on the sightseeing idea thinking it would be very interesting.

### Hence, our idea in three parts:
- Driving and controlling a car
A user will be able to control the car both in real life and in the game just by using the arrows (up, left, right, down) which adds up to the overall
experience of having a 100% user-engaging game.
- Thinking of countries:
We realized that it's going to be very interesting to add different cities and countries, while also adding the pictures of countries' most remarkable
places. Thus, we decided to choose 3 countries - travel destinations where the user can go - France, Italy and Japan.
- Adding some spice:
Adding a sightseeing experience to make the game feel more enjoyable.
