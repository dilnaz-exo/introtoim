## Video Game: International Road Trip

### A little background:
Since the idea of our game initially involved a "car moving" aspect for that, we explored different options of making this game as engaging and fun as
possible for the user. We were thinking of only making a "traveling" or "sightseeing" kind of game where the background scenery changes according to the
time change/speed or anything like that. There, we stopped on the sightseeing idea thinking it would be very interesting.
