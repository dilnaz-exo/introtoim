here are the pictures of my circuit:

## My expectations

I don't know why but at first I was really intimidated by the assignment requirements, and was afraid to start, because photoresistor is something that
I didn't work with before. But then I realized that since we already worked with the potentiometer, another analog input will also be very similar to that.
Before even starting, I knew that I want to work with the photoresistor, which is why I decided to rewatch the recording of the previous class, and tried
building the circuit myself.

## Process
Trying to build the circuits myself really helped me understand the logic and the connection between all the wires and other elements of Arduino. I think
I understood why and how everything is used and connected between each other. For example, I think I finally got the reason why we actually connect our wire
to GND(ground).
