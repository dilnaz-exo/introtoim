I was very excited to start working with the hardware in this course once I learned that there is a whole section for this. And although I took physics in
high school, I haven't really worked with circuits before, which is why it feels so new and so interesting to me. First when I thought of which exactly circuit to make, I was thinking of different conductors that I can use in this homework. Thus, I considered many things: graphite, silver dishes (like spoons, forks, etc) and etc.
