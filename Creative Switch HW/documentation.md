I was very excited to start working with the hardware in this course once I learned that there is a whole section for this. And although I took physics in
high school, I haven't really worked with circuits before, which is why it feels so new and so interesting to me. First when I thought of which exactly circuit to make, I was thinking of different conductors that I can use in this homework. Thus, I considered many things: graphite, some dishes (like spoons, forks, etc) and etc.

At the end, I decided to use my ring to conduct the electricity and to make a switch with it.

Not all rings conduct electricity, and it depends on the ring material (I realized that this can also be used to check if the ring material is displayed correctly or not). That's why after using several rings, I succeeded with this one:

The circuit that I built for this homework is very simple, yet I understood that since the board is so small it's sometimes possible to stick wires in another part and therefore the result will not be shown. Thus, I was glad to memorize the placement of the wires and LED light to make everything work accordingly.

Overall, it was very interesting to work with the creative switch and a circuit, and I can't wait to learn more.
