My codes ended up not looking the way I wanted them to, but please keep in mind that I actually spent hours trying out things.

# Documentation
## Before starting:
I had a lot of ideas before starting this homework and was so excited to actually begin coding. As I have told you, at first I wanted to make a canvas divided into
two parts, with one text on one side and another text on the next side. And I wanted to make them somehow animated to give them a more generative look.
But then, I decided to go with another approach, which means that I wanted my text to increase in size and when it reaches the maximum, I wanted it to kind of pop,
and the hearts to fly out of them.

## Process:
I really struggled with the code the whole time, and realized that even if I understand the logic of everything we learned separately, when it comes to putting things
together and actually creating something, I really get lost, which is why I used your advice about outputing one piece of code at a time. This is what I used in my new
version of code and it was really helpful because it let me see my mistakes right away. However, there were still things that I couldn't figure out, for example, how to
make the text kind of pop when the size reaches maximum. So i just stopped there.

## What I would like to become better at:
I really need to practice more with combining different functions and methods to create different things in order to see how various combinations of code actually work.
