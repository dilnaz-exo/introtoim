# The musical Instrument presented by Liza Datsenko & Dilnaz Amantayeva
We worked together for our assignment to create a musical instrument.
Progression of our ideas: When we first learned about the assignment, it was really exciting to think of creating a special musical instrument 
completely out of the analog and digital sensors. At first, when we looked through the arduino musical instrument ideas, we wanted to make something
different, using all of our creativity. We were particularly astonished by the idea of using many photoresistors, so that when we move our hand 
above the resistors, different sounds would come out. However, we thought that it would be too easy and too used up 
as a musical instrument, so we continued brainstorming other ideas. Liza suggested to use force sensors and create something similar to a game 
“dance board” by placing those force sensors on the floor. However, to do that we would need really long wires, so moved the idea to tapping the force sensors 
with fingers. For Dilnaz, it was very interesting to work with the servo motor, and we saw a potential of making something similar to maracas.

The idea was to use Kinder Joy, put grains into the eggs and somehow stick them to the motor. Thus, when the motor would move, the eggs would 
also move and create an interesting sound. We gathered all the necessary materials and decided to stick to that idea of including both creative 
maracas and tappable force sensors (call it drums or piano).

Process: 1). We met for the first time and did some research, looking for ideas of what to make. We watched over a dozen videos of previous projects and 
as a result came up with the idea of what to do. 2). When meeting the second time we tried doing some hardware. As the initial idea was to make a servo 
motor work when the force sensor is touched we tried doing that. (1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B6IWCxnUmQ ) Also, we wanted to control the volume with 
the potentiometer. (2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr8Temem_2M ). 

 Issues we had: Motor servo was not working in the if statement. The sound was still playing when the force sensor was off (we believe that the problem
was a potentiometer). 
 The potentiometer was not working together with the force sensor (we were trying to control the sound with the potentiometer).
